New Year’s Resolution: Teach programming in your organization
=============================================================

As we are approaching New Year it is time to think of new resolutions that we’ll work on in 2017. I’m sure you already have by now a lot of ideas on your list.

I’m challenging you to accept a new resolution… that may sound a little bit extreme at first sight: if you have software development skills, teach programming lessons for non-programmers in your organization!

I guarantee you that you’ll create a lot of interest and a lot of people will join your class. Make the invitation open to everybody: to people in testing, to people in QA, to office assistance, etc.

The success of this project is to keep it simple: no books, no powerpoints. Just a conference room with a whiteboard and a projector. Ask everyone to bring their laptops and spend 1 hour quality time writing code and scribbling on the whiteboard.

One more condition: do it in a way that doesn’t impact your daily business activities. Perhaps in the lunch room or after hours. And do it for the entire 2017!

What will happen next will be impressive: you’ll see how people are happily skipping lunch and take time out of their busy schedule just to challenge themselves with intellectual activities in your class. You’ll see how a new creative and engaging environment starts to build in your organization...

Steve Job said “Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think”.

Introduce the program gently to your people. Encourage them to grow themselves into this new area. Not all of them will become coders … but having coding knowledge will surely help them better with their personal goals and organization goals.

Remember them that even president Obama took the challenge to code:

Start now! … and if you managed to create new programmers in your organization drop me a line! I’m always happy to hear success stories!
