Z80 Tools
=========

Long time ago, when working on Sinclair ZX-Spectrum, I was always intrigued by the 'realistic' screens from some games.

Today, ZX-Spectrum is an ancient machine and you probably don't have any use for one.

However for nostalgics willing to create Spectrum software, I'm providing a few DOS based tools to assisting with this process:

- BMP2SCR - Convert .BMP files (BW and Color!!!) to ZX-Spectrum screens with attributes
- SCR2TAP - Convert .SCR files to .TAP files for usage with ZX-Spectrum emulators

These free tools will be uploaded on http://www.worldofspectrum.org for reaching a wider audience.
