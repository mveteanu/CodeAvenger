From 8 bit to 16 bit
====================

It's time to leave my trusty HC-90 computer behind and move to PC World.
After so many years spent in BASIC and Z80 Assembly, I think is time to invest more time into programming on PC computers.

I hope that some day I will be able to transfer on a ZX-Spectrum emulator all the code I wrote and saved on tapes on my HC-90 computer.
