Expose kids to coding during Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day 
====================================================================

Every year, millions of workplaces, children and parents will participate in the [“Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day”](https://daughtersandsonstowork.org/). It is a great opportunity for students to see how their classroom lessons apply to the workplace. 

If you are working in a software company, is a great opportunity to expose kids to coding during this event. A hands-on coding activity will offer them the best appreciation for their parent’s job. 

Therefore, besides the regular office tour and pizza, try to organize also an [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/) session. There are many programming languages that you can show to the kids including Python and / or JavaScript. Of course, you need to use a kid friendly environment such as [CodeGuppy](https://codeguppy.com) or any other web based environment which lets kids taste coding in a fun way without complex installs. Ask one developer from your organization to organize this session and introduce the kids to coding.
