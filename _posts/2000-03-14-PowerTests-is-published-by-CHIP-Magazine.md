PowerTests is published by CHIP Magazine
========================================

A few weeks ago I've sent PowerTest for review to CHIP Magazine. Today I got pleasantly surprised to see a nice review in the latest issue of the magazine.
They even included the PowerTest software on the CD that acompanies the magazine.

This is "free advertising" for me! Just create a nice software and people are willing to publish it or review it for free for you!
