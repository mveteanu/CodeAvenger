Coding for kids
===============

There are many coding platforms for kids. Some are using block based coding while others are going directly for text based coding.
I'm a strong proponent of text based coding even for young kids - since this is the real coding.

As for the best coding language for kids, the world is usually split between Python and JavaScript.

Introducing codeguppy.com
-------------------------

I want to introduce you a new coding platform for kids based on JavaScript: [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com)

The platform is versatile and allow development of a wide range of programs such as graphical programs or even games! As a matter of fact building games is very easy with [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com) since the platform comes with built-in assets such as animated sprites, backgrounds, music and sound effects.

Behind the scenes
-----------------

The runtime of [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com) is powered by a few nice open source libraries very appreciated in education: p5.js, p5.play, p5.SceneManager and TurtleGFX.

Adults can have fun too
-----------------------

Due to the platform capabilities, adults can also use it for recreational coding. The [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com) website even includes example programs that are appealing to adults and software professionals.
