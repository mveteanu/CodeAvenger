Run legacy business applications using DOSBOX
=============================================

[DOSBOX](https://www.dosbox.com/) is an emulator program that emulates an IBM PC computer running DOS operating system. Think of it as virtual machine for running DOS based applications.

Although developed to primarily run old DOS games on new hardware, DOSBOX can be succesfully used to run also legacy DOS business applications on your latest Windows 10 computer.

A few month ago I anounced that I [open-source my old software](2017-02-06-I-open-source-my-old-software.md). As part of the process I wanted to capture screen shots and videos showcasing the applications. DOSBOX helped succesfully with this job. By using DOSBOX I was able to run again 20 years old software.

As weirds at may seem, there are still many DOS based applications outhere running on old hardware. Their owners have difficulties upgrading the hardware since those applications are not running on latest hardware and / or software. DOSBOX may prove a viable solution to these situations.
