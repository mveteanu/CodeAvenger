I open-source my old software
=============================

Long before my [Abbott / STARLIMS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mveteanu) life, I used to create software as independent software developer under VMASOFT [http://www.vmasoft.net](http://www.vmasoft.net). 
My releases were mostly shareware products ranging from web based educational titles to assembler optimized graphic libraries and various other tools.

The educational software titles PowerTests and PowerTests.NET [http://www.powertests.net](http://www.powertests.net) were particularly well received by educational institutions in those times.

This was 15 â€“ 20+ years ago. 

Recently, I decided to un-dust some of my old software in a new format: open-source projects on GitHub: [http://github.com/mveteanu](http://github.com/mveteanu)
