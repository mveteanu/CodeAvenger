My latest article about technology just got published by prestigious Romanian computer magazine: [NET Report](http://www.pcreport.ro).

In the future I intend to publish more articles about other aspects of DHTML and Internet Explorer.

Note: The "Internet Explorer Technologies" article is the result of the research behind the web-based [PowerTests.NET](http://www.powertests.net) application.
